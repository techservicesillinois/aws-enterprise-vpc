## [0.11.0] - 2021-06-14

### Changed
- requires Terraform 1.x
- assign_ipv6_address_on_creation silently ignored for non-IPv6 subnets, can be enabled in vpc/terraform.tfvars
- default vpc/terraform.tfvars now enables IPv6 for VPC and subnets (but still does not auto-assign to interfaces)

## [0.10.0] - 2021-06-07

### Added
- accept Resource Access Manager (RAM) shares from other accounts
- attach to Transit Gateway (shared from the Core Services account)
- route from VPC to Transit Gateway based on shared prefix lists
- support Amazon-assigned IPv6 (but disabled by default) for public- and private-facing subnets
- Terraform module to bootstrap S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for remote state
- example-service demonstrates cloud-init
- convenient IAM Role for creating Flow Logs
- vpn-connection now supports Transit Gateway (as well as VPN Gateway)
- prevent accidental destruction/replacement of RDNS forwarders
- rdns-forwarder custom metrics for mem and disk usage

### Changed
- requires Terraform 0.15.x
- backend configuration for Terraform remote state is moved to backend.tf
- other common choices can now be made in terraform.tfvars rather than editing main.tf
- default for vpc environment now omits NAT gateways (to save money) leaving private-facing subnets with no outbound Internet access
- default for vpc environment now omits private-facing subnets
- rdns-forwarder updated to Amazon Linux 2, t4g.micro
- example-service updated to Amazon Linux 2, t3.nano
- vpn-connection CloudWatch Alarm uses native metrics instead of old custom "VPNStatus" metrics
- vpn-connection CloudWatch Alarm is now located in the VPN connection's region instead of a fixed singleton region
- SNS topics for VPN monitoring alerts are now per-region
- pcx_ids in subnet modules is now map instead of list, and dependencies are implicit
- attach vgw to vpc using explicit aws_vpn_gateway_attachment resource (instead of vpc_id attribute)

### Deprecated
- dedicated campus-facing VPN connections from each VPC (use Transit Gateway instead)

### Removed
- old custom "VPNStatus" metrics solution (Lambda deployed via CloudFormation)



## [0.9.0] - 2019-10-30

### Added
- explicitly specify private ASN for aws_vpn_gateway
- new Interface VPC Endpoint for SNS
- apply tags to more resources: VPC Endpoints, rdns-forwarder IAM role, vpn-connection Alarm
- optional top-level var.tags in each environment

### Changed
- requires Terraform 0.12.x (and AWS provider 2.x)
- generates details.json instead of details.txt
- vpc.* outputs renamed to vpc_*
- vpn-connection config output is no longer wrapped in here-document delimiters
- use for_each instead of count (for pcx_ids and endpoints)
- create aws_route_table in subnet-common instead of subclasses
- rdns-forwarder: use ec2_metadata_facts instead of deprecated alias ec2_facts

### Fixed
- vpc/rdns: avoid temporarily leaving VPC with no associated DHCP options set when reverting to Option 1



## [0.8.2] - 2018-11-02

### Changed
- update GitHub links to reflect renaming our GitHub organization from cites-illinois to techservicesillinois

### Added
- prevent accidental destruction of VPC and VPN connections
- all modules now accept input variables for common and per-resource custom tags
- support Interface VPC Endpoints (disabled by default)

### Changed
- refactor VPC Endpoints from vpc/main.tf to separate vpc/endpoints.tf



## [0.8.0] - 2018-02-01

### Added
- cleanly support multiple VPC environments in different regions (leveraging one global environment)
- new Gateway VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB
- apply tags to more resources: nat-gateway and EIP, rdns-forwarder EBS volume and SG
- rdns-forwarder: add an explicit "forward first" to each zone statement for clarity
- vpn-connection: expose distinct alarm_actions, insufficient_data_actions, ok_actions

### Changed
- requires Terraform 0.11.x
- deploy VPN Monitoring in us-east-2 instead of us-east-1
